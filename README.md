This requires Python 3.9 to run (not guaranteed to run on any other version). All dependent python libraries must be manually installed.

If you wish to build it to an exe file on windows, you will need PyInstaller as well. After installing, change the path in build.bat to the folder where the library file 'pnet.pt' of facenet_pytorch is located. Then run the build.bat file to generate the build.
